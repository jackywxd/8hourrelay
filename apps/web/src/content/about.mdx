# Vancouver 8 Hour Relay

Vancouver 8 Hour Relay is organized by Vancouver Community Runners (“VCR”), which is composed of three running groups in the Greater Vancouver area: IRUN Club, CROSSNA, and WIND Running Club.

Our unified goals are to promote communication between runners from different cities, to participate with a unified appearance in local races as well as races around the world, and to combine resources to better serve and support all runners and communities.

The main objective of the 2022 Vancouver 8 Hour Relay is to bring together runners from different cities. This will encourage everyone to train and exercise with a focused approach during the Covid-19 pandemic. Running promotes physical health and staying connected with others promotes mental health.
