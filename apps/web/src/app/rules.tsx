								<div>
									The basic coefficient is calculated based on
									the qualification time for Boston Marathon
									(BQ) (see the table below – Boston present
									qualifying times 2020). <br />
									<br />
									The coefficient = Marathon BQ time / 200
									minutes (see Coefficient Table below).
									<br />
									<br />
									Each team calculates the total coefficient
									minutes by taking the corresponding
									coefficient based on each member’s age and
									gender (from the table below) multiplied by
									the registered running minutes and adding it
									up. <br />
									<br />
									The weighted coefficient = the total
									coefficient minutes / 480 minutes (rounded
									up to 4 decimals)
									<br />
									<br />
									The “baton” must be passed from one member
									to another with a 1-minute buffer before or
									after the designated time. If the “baton” is
									passed outside the buffer, for each minute
									earlier or delayed, the team will be
									penalized by subtracting one kilometer from
									its covered distance in record keeping. Any
									time under one minute will be counted as one
									minute for penalty. <br />
									<br />
									For omissions or disputes in the rules of
									the competition, the organizing committee
									has the final interpretation and
									decision-making power.
